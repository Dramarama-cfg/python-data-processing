Hi, guys ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to this repository created to showcase my data-related skills.

Each project is presented in the form of a Jupyter notebook and does not include separate source files. Instead, the Jupyter notebook serve as an overview of the project, accompanied by comments explaining the main parts and its functionality.

Please feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions. Thank you for visiting! :)
