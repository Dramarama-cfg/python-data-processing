# Data Analyst portfolio

Hi, guys. Welcome to this repository created to showcase my skills.

Projects in this repository are related to data processing, web scraping and data validation. The primary focus of these projects has been to automate daily processes, enhance efficiency, and minimize human errors.

Through these projects, I have aimed to demonstrate my ability to develop practical solutions that streamline workflows and improve overall productivity.

Each project is presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks and does not include separate source files. Instead, the Jupyter notebooks serve as an overview of the project, accompanied by comments explaining the main parts of the code and its functionality.

Please feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions. Thank you for visiting! :)
